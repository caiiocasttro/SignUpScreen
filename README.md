# Sign Up (With Combine)

## Sign Up page developed to practice Combine

### üí° About the project 

This project was developed in order to practice combine. Thinking about an already existing project I have on my portfolio, I decided to build a sign-up page that uses Combine to check if the textfields are empty or not, in order to enable the register button if textField is not empty and disable it if it is empty.

### üßê How it works

* 1 Combine checks if all the textFields are not empty
* 2 Send the notification to the register button which is the subscriber
* 3 The register button is enabled if the notification tells that the textFields are not empty, if the notification tells that all or one textField is empty, the register button is no longer enabled.
